Aniah's behaviour was designed using the training algorithm of the ml-agent neural network. In the following file, certain behaviours were given positive or negative rewards. During the training procedure, rewards are will narrow down the behaviour to a favourable state through the rearrangement of the ml-agent neural network.
The code file also features code for heursitc (manually controlled) behaviours of the agent.
